## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Run Instructions

### 1. Backend (FastAPI)

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, pip

**Install dependencies:**
```sh
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pip install python-multipart pytest
```

**Environment:**
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root and fill in secrets (if needed)

**Run the server:**
```sh
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

**Database:**
- Uses SQLite by default (`pathcraft.db` for app, `test.db` for tests)
- Alembic migrations in `database/migrations/`

**API Reference:**
- See `backend/API_REFERENCE.md` for endpoints

### 2. Frontend (Flutter)

**Requirements:** Flutter SDK, Dart

**Setup:**
- Navigate to `frontend/` and run:
	```sh
	flutter pub get
	flutter run
	```
- The main app code is in `frontend/lib/`

### 3. Machine Learning (ML)

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, pip, scikit-learn, pandas, etc.

**Setup:**
- Navigate to `ml/` and install any extra requirements as needed
- Scripts for training and data generation are in `ml/`

## üß™ Running Tests

### Backend Tests
From the project root:
```sh
pytest
```
or to run a specific test file:
```sh
pytest tests/test_backend.py
```
Tests use a temporary SQLite database (`test.db`).

### Frontend & ML Tests
- (Planned) Add tests for Flutter and ML modules

---

## üì¶ Environment & Files

- `.env`, `.db`, and other sensitive/generated files are git-ignored (see `.gitignore`)
- Virtual environments (`.venv/`, `env/`) and IDE files are ignored

---

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
3. Add tests for new features
4. Open a pull request with a clear description

---

## üõü Troubleshooting

- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError` for `backend`, set `PYTHONPATH` to the project root:
	```sh
	set PYTHONPATH=%cd%  # Windows
	export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)  # macOS/Linux
	```
- If you see `RuntimeError: Form data requires "python-multipart"`, install it:
	```sh
	pip install python-multipart
	```
- For database errors, delete `test.db` and rerun tests
